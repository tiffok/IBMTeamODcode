# UF IBM Team Outlier Detection Code

This is the repository for the UF-IBM Outlier Detection Practicum. Files can be found in the following folders:

1. Current Algorithm Code: most up-to-date versions of code for each method
2. Non-Algorithm Code: for code to be used in other files, but not detection methods (e.g. converting files, generating confusion matrices)
3. Old Code: Previous versions of code for different outlier detection methods
4. MAT files: datasets from the ODDS website used in the finished code.
5. CSV files: CSVs of datasets from ODDS websites. Note: CSVs will not work with most of the files in the Current Algorithm Code folder.
