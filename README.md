# UF IBM Team Outlier Detection Code

This is the repository for the UF-IBM Outlier Detection Practicum. Files can be found in the following folders:

1. Ensemble Method Code: code used for running the ensemble method
2. Individual Algorithm Code: code for individual algorithms and other non-ensemble method code
3. Non-Algorithm Code: for code to be used in other files, but not detection methods (e.g. converting files, generating confusion matrices)
4. Old Code: Previous versions of code for different outlier detection methods
5. MAT files: datasets from the ODDS website used in the finished code.
6. CSV files: CSVs of datasets from ODDS websites. Note: CSVs will not work with most of the files in the Current Algorithm Code folder.
